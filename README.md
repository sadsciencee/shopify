# @sadsciencee/shopify-remix
A collection of full stack patterns that I'm 
tired of copy/pasting between apps for my clients.

The functionality enabled by this library assumes a 
Shopify app with Remix, Vite, React and Polaris.

The following are required for client side 
fetching in the File Picker and Autocomplete Search

- [direct access API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library)
- [App Bridge v4](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library)

These patterns require fairly tight integration of client-side and server-side code, 
and rely on Remix imports in both client-side and server-side imports. Sorry, Next.js enjoyers.

## File Picker
WIP

## App Bridge v4 Max Modal
